Generates shortcodes for all 35 possible column layouts when using Genesis column classes.

== Description ==

This plugin generates shortcodes for every column configuration available with the column classes built into the Genesis Framework by [StudioPress](http://www.studiopress.com). Shortcodes are easily added using a custom button in your Wordpress editor.

= Plugin Highlights =
* 35 different responsive column configuration available
* Includes two utility shortcodes to assist with layout
* Only adds one button to your Wordpress editor
* Custom button design integrates seamlessly with the core Wordpress aesthetic
* Developed for Genesis Framework users but usable by all! (See note on Installation page)

If you have questions or would like to request additional features, such as additional utility shortcodes, please let me know in the plugin support forum. 


== Installation ==

1. You have a couple options:
	* *Go to Plugins->Add New and search for "Genesis Columns Advanced”. Once found, click "Install".
	* *Download the folder from Wordpress.org and zip the folder. Then upload via Plugins->Add New->Upload.
2. Activate the plugin through the 'Plugins' menu in WordPress.
3. From the ‘Plugins’ page, head to a post/page and check out the new button in your editor.
4. If you have any implementation questions, please post in the plugin support forum.

**Please Note:** This plugin was designed for Genesis Framework users. Genesis is a premium product by [StudioPress](http://www.studiopress.com). However, if you are a non-Genesis user, this plugin will still activate. A special stylesheet (gca-optional-styles.css) will be applied to the frontend of your site so that you can generate columns too! 

== Frequently Asked Questions ==

= Why is there no option for five even columns, or columns broken down by fifths? =

This was a conscious decision in order for the plugin stay inline with the column classes offered by the Genesis Framework. The informational page on Genesis’s column classes can be found on [Studiopress.com](http://my.studiopress.com/tutorials/content-column-classes/). As of Genesis v2.1.2, there unfortunately is no option for fifths. If this changes in the future, I will update this plugin.
